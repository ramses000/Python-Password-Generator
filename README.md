# Random Password Generator

This is the first Python project tutorial I have followed along on. I added functionality after the video to add the option for the user to choose between having uppercase characters in their password or not. My ability to follow along with the instructions and explanations followed up with being able to add new functionality to this project, has made me enthusiastic and hopeful for my future studies of Python.
